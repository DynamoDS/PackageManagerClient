This repo is the package manager client for the Dynamo Package Manager. Package Manager Client is designed to cover all of the capabilities of the Dynamo Package Manager.

#### The Package Manager Client can do the following for you:

* properly format, compress, and upload a package to the server
* properly format, compress, and upload a new package version to the server
* download a specific package header
* download a specific package body
* determine server connectivity
* upvote or downvote a package, collect user votes
* search across packages
* deprecate a package
* manage maintainers of a package
* manage authentication

#### The Package Manager Client doesn't do this for you:

* magically find all of the dependencies your package has (that's up to you)
* provide Autodesk 360 login credentials

#### Steps to build The Package Manager Client solution:

* From Visual Studio IDE:

    Build the `PackageManagerClient\src\GregClient.sln` solution

* From command line:

    ```bat
    dotnet build --configuration Release src/GregClient.sln
    ```

#### How to increment the assembly version:

Locate the [GregClient.csproj](https://github.com/DynamoDS/PackageManagerClient/blob/master/src/GregClient/GregClient.csproj) and change the `Version` property.
